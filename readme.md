## What is this?
This is my modifed version of [bad-asn-list](https://github.com/brianhama/bad-asn-list). That contains many other things, Including sub folders for other providers. From Specific VPN Providers to VPS & General Use VPN Providers (Datacamp, M247, etc)

## You may ask "But isnt there another list made by blank why not use that"
I made this cause the one stated above is just a giant mess of ASN's nothing is sorted to proper types and what those ASN's are used for.
